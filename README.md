# DeepLearning

#### This repository includes projects completed as a part of Deep Learning Nanodegree program. It starts with building a simple neural network to building a generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate realistic faces.   

##### 1. Bike Share Neural Network 
###### This is the first project completed in the nanodegree program where we use bike share data set and build a prediction model using a neural network to predict the number of bike share users on any given day.
