# DeepLearning

#### This repository includes projects completed as a part of Deep Learning Nanodegree program. It starts with building a simple neural network to building a generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate realistic faces.   

##### 1. Bike Share Neural Network 
###### This is the first project completed in the nanodegree program where we use bike share data set and build a prediction model using a neural network to predict the number of bike share users on any given day. 

##### 2. Sentiment Analysis with Andrew Trask 
###### This project is based on lectures by Andrew Trask on sentiment analysis and contains step-by-step introduction to sentiment analysis using IMDB movie reviews dataset. 

##### 3. Image Classification CIFAR-10
###### The project implements a convolutional neural network on CIFAR-10 dataset which contains images from 10 different categories.  

##### 4. TV Script Generation
###### In this project we implement a recurrent neural network to generate TV script. We use part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The recurrent neural network generates a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

##### 5. Language Translation
###### The project uses a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

##### 6. Face Generation
###### The project uses a generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
